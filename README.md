This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The landing page uses Tailwind CSS and system fonts for easy customization.

### Supabase configuration

Demo bookings are stored in a Supabase table. Provide credentials in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key # optional
```
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are required for the booking form to submit successfully. If row level security is enabled on your `appointments` table, also provide `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` so the API route can insert new rows.
